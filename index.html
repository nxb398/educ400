I was born and raised in India, I immigrated to Canada in 2000 with my husband and two young children. With nothing much to do at home, I started volunteering in my son’s kindergarten classroom to keep myself busy. This gave me the opportunity to establish new connections in a foreign land. I completed the Para-Educator program and started working as an Education Assistant. Over the years, I grew as an educator, acquired skills to work with students while encouraging their independence. </p></div>
                    <div class="col-lg-4 me-auto"><p class="lead"> The teacher assistant role has been challenging, rewarding and at times, frustrating because of its limited job profile. I felt the need to move on into a broader role to fulfill my potential as an educator. The recent shift in education towards student centered approach, project-based experiential learning, and introduction of social emotional strategies in school curriculum enabled me to move forward in my own journey of career development. Beside working with children, I enjoy being outdoors and travelling.</p></div>

                                    <h3> Colonization of education</h3>
                                    <p class="mb-4" style="text-align: left; line-height: 200%;">
                                      The purpose of education through colonial lens is to learn the course content by memorizing or practicing enough to get good grades, get admission for higher studies, and with the professional degree secure a high paying job, at least I believed so. As I went through the readings offered in EDUC# 400, was able to grasp the idea that white, western European culture molded the socio-cultural, economic, and political practices to their benefit.
                                      Stanley, T. (2003) in his case study scribed, “State-controlled schooling was integral to the construction of supremacist hegemony in BC.” He further voiced that white supremacist ideologies were not only offered as superior and solitary choice, but other exciting culture and race were rendered as ‘morally depraved and illegitimate’ thus okay to be indoctrinated (p.44).
                                      <br /> <br /> I have not questioned the education system before or analyze it in this angle. It was like revealing the conspiracy in a horror story. The more I read, was frustrated, felt brainwashed and diminutive about my own ignorance. Colonization of education has served the dominant to rule, oppress insignificant and widened the gaps between the two.
                                    </p>
                                    <h3>Redefining Education</h3>
                                  <p class="mb-4" style="text-align: left; line-height: 200%;">
                                    Education has become synonym to economic progress and technological advancement. It has enhanced the polarization of wealth and means. Contemporary education emphasizes on theories, answers, conceptual and technical knowledge instead of questions, values, and ethics. Purpose of education is to enable humans as responsible caretakers, who use their knowledge to restore the balance of our natural world (Orr, 2004 p.12-14).
                                  </p>
                                  <img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/p1-1.jpg" />
                                  <p class="mb-4" style="text-align: left; line-height: 200%;">
                                    That means education should be meaningful to individuals, help them enhance their skills and knowledge to contribute back locally and globally. Eisner, (2002) affirms, “Education is a process of learning to create ourselves” (p.3).  Now the questions come to mind such as: How can we guide children where their learning is important, not the results? How can this shift in the education practices is attainable? Most of us are the products of the colonial education system, been benefitted and continued to get advantage from it. Until we analyse critically, understand, and accept the harm it caused to other cultures, and languages, we cannot make any progress. The next step we can take by including Indigenous people and other settlers’ cultural practices and languages into our current pedagogies.
                                  </p>
                                  <h3>Indigenizing education</h3>
                                  <img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/p1-2.jpg" />
                                  <p class="mb-4" style="text-align: left; line-height: 200%;">
                                    Indigenous learnings, which were undervalued and systematically diminished by colonial system, are based on wellbeing of self, family, community, and the land. Davidson, S. (2021) in her Sk’ada’ Principles you tube video explains the values of Indigenous ways of learning. Her video enabled me to figure out the importance of learning by heart and why it is different. When children were taught in their native environment by the people who they have strong relationship, learning happens naturally through observation, curiosity and mimicking the actions of others. To restore the balance between human and nature, native practices are much more relevant today than ever before.
                                  </p>

                                      Going off from redefining education my attention has shifted to the effects of colonial education on our ways of living over time. Self-sustaining civilizations were marginalized, growth of industrialization and consumerism led us believe that happiness and wellbeing can be achieved through consumptions (Murphy, 2000). Desire to consume more, distorted the natural balance between human and the world around. We are facing the Corona virus pandemic globally. Locally we delt with wildfires, heat domes and are facing the worst flooding in the region. We have failed to see that we are part of this nature. We will be finished without it.

                                      David Chang in the Land-Based Eco-Justice seminar explained that restoration of eco-system is essential to human survival. He explained that marginalized groups who face the inequalities are worst affected with environmental damages such as air pollution, water contamination, poor housing and under lying health conditions. Environmental justice aims to provide fair chances to them. Aboriginal culture practices respect the land and protect it. By adapting the Indigenous perspective, we can conserve and save the land and water. Kimmer, R. (2014) wrote, “To become naturalized is to live as if your children’s future matters, to take care of land as if our lives and the lives of our relatives depend on it. Because they do” (p.215).
                                      <br /> <br />I resonated most with the slide where David quotes Simpson, L, “if you want to learn about something, you need to take your body onto the land and do it,” First and foremost thing is to be outside, not confined in the four walls of the classroom. Plan your lesson according to place around your school community, take students to natural places, give them time to connect, go back and let them explore, observe, and be part of that place.
                                      <br /> <br />Another story of land-based pedagogy stayed with me was fish ladder project. In Exploration B teacher advocacy presentations, Alexander (Ola) Cholewa who works at an Environmental school at Maple Ridge talked about fish ladder awareness project. She described this project as a learning opportunity where students were engaged in an activity which they were passionate about, felt connected with, and channeled their skills and energy for a cause.

                                      Looking back at my notes, I highlighted some words which represented the deep engagement of the students. Students put their minds to learn from their hearts. That is what I want to bring in my classroom. Enable students to care for the cause they believe in and turn their ideas into reality without worrying about winning or losing.

                                      My educational commitment as teaching assistant was limited to the inclusion of students with clinical diagnosis into the regular classrooms. I am frustrated with ableism views and people’s idea of correcting or comparing students with disabilities to a typical or regular student. Leaving no one behind is the message I gather from the series of you tube videos, getting to know their stories and experiences. Disability combined with other differentiations based on individuals’ race, culture, religion, language, or socio-economic status amplified their challenges to survive and lead a normal life. Inequalities are socially constructed and deep rooted into our lives. We are so tuned with them that we do not even see until someone points at it. Then we simply agree with the mainstream narratives of inequalities without doing anything about it. People with disability can contribute to the society, so it is not okay to deprive them with amenities which our available to able body people. Young, S. (2014, April) affirms in her Ted talk that we have been lied about disability is a Bad Thing and it does not make people exceptional to live with disability. As a society we assume that people with disability cannot overcome with their challenges. Apart from the bodily limitations and diagnosis, people with disability are real people, they deserve to be treated who they are. I want to move forward in my educational journey with Stella’s words, “I want to live in a world where disability is not the exception, but the norm… where we don’t have such low expectations of disabled people”. Disability is not a thing to pity on. We must educate ourselves what people with challenges can do and provide support so they have equal opportunities to progress. As a future educator, I will render every opportunity to include students with disability in my lessons. I will connect with them, try to know them well, learn from them, listen to the stories they want to share.

                                      Brian Gidinski’s blog post addressing harmful public rhetoric, put me on the memory lane of my own university days. I graduated from Banasthali Vidyapith, a residential education institution which offers education to girls from second grade to getting a doctorate degree. Lesbian culture was evident in hostels, but overtly no one talked about it. There was no acceptance for lesbian relationships in the culture or society. There were many stories of students committing suicides, eloping, and found dead afterwards, ached my heart, but not gave me courage to challenge or voice my concern. We have come a long way from my college days’ experience to people expressing their sexual identity in their later years of life when they feel somewhat safe to take the bold step of coming out and revealing their identity. There is much work needed to be done in schools where children do not have a safe armour around. I could not agree more with the objective of SOGI in schools as Brian Gidinski explains, “What we do, as educators is make safe, inclusive spaces, so that students who have different experiences of gender are able to learn in an environment where they are not harassed, ridiculed or shamed for who they are, or who the members of their families are.” These students are vulnerable but safeguarding them does not mean putting others at risk.
                                    <br /> <br /> Secondly, as an educator we should talk about the topics of sexual identity at early ages. Childhood innocence is a myth. Jean Piaget’s theory of cognitive development and Lev Vygotsky’s sociocultural theory are set of assumptions how children learn. Children are producers and product of culture in that sense adults should not set standards for children’s learning capacities by age or grade. Children begin learning informally from their families, media, and the people who they interact with (Kelly, M. & Brooks, M, 2009, p.214).
                                    <br /> <br /> My takeaway from the article, Young children and social justice, and Bryan Gidinski’s blog and presentation is to bring awareness towards different sexual orientation in my classroom.
                                    By doing so, if I can save one life or even create a safe environment, I can bring little peace to myself and to my friends who lost their lives.

                                      It took me a while to overcome with my own fear of advancing in my career. It was easier to sit back and criticize the short comings of current pedagogies with my presumptions. It was a challenge to dismantle my own believes about schooling, and Indigenous communities. To question and talk about complex issues was the hardest. We are genetically wired to find patterns and structure. It is simpler to follow a trail without thinking where it is leading us. But once you are aware that it is not the right trail, you are set to look for other options. EDUC# 400 gave me the right reasons to believe that education practices need to be revolutionized. I am aware that learning can happen outside of the school walls, we learn when we are not emotionally distressed, our curiosity led us to find new knowledge. We can learn from nature, from people who we relate to, without set standards of evaluation and pedagogies. Learning is rooted into languages and cultures. All students are valuable contributor to the school community, and everyone have a unique story to tell. Astrid Pedneault in her presentation advice future educators to honour the process of learning then the outcomes. Guide their learning by suggesting what happens when… or what if we try this. Together with your students decide what to learn and how to learn. Focus on what do they want? what do they like? what are their passion? what makes them happy? Remember that children learn with senses, emotions, and imagination.

                                      Learning is a lifelong journey; it requires me to connect and work with others. I need to think about where I want to be and evaluate my options to be there. On my way, I might discover a new turn and a new horizon to explore, which is okay as long as I am progressing in the right direction.
