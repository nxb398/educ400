                      I am privileged to reside, work and play on the unsurrendered and unceded traditional territories of Coast Salish People which include Katzie, Tsawwassen, Stó:lō, Wsáneć and Kwantlen People.
                      I am thankful to this land because it gives me opportunity to make connections and build a home away from my ancestral home. I wish well for all living being.

                    <p style="text-indent: 0.5in;line-height: 200%;font-size: 18px;">I am Namita a PDP student at Simon Fraser University. I am born and raised in India, immigrated to Canada in year 2000 with my husband and two young children. With nothing much to do at home, I started volunteering in my elder son’s kindergarten classroom to keep myself busy. This opportunity opened many venues for me to establish new connections in a foreign land. I completed the Para Educator program and started working as an Education Assistant. Over the years, I grew as an educator, acquired many skills to work with students while encouraging their independence. Teacher assistant role has been challenging, rewarding and at times, frustrating because of its limited job profile. I felt the need to move on into a broader role to fulfill my potential as an educator. The recent shift in education towards student centered approach, project-based experiential learning, and introduction of social emotional strategies in school curriculum enabled me to move forward in my own journey of career development. Beside working with children, I enjoy being outdoors and travelling. </p>
                    <p style="text-indent: 0.5in;line-height: 200%; font-size: 18px;">Though my formal schooling happened in India, I have the same lived experience as most of you have in Canadian education system. I believed in one-sided stories, anecdotal evidence, and mainstream ideologies without questioning. Educ#400 course activities, readings and webinars made me realize that I am the product of this system. I have bounced back between yielding advantages and facing hardships because of my position in context. Conveniently, I criticized the short comings of present school system without engaging in any inquiry.</p>
                    <p style="text-indent: 0.5in;line-height: 200%; font-size: 18px;">Throughout this semester, my believes and biases were challenged. To me, schooling and learning was the same, indigenous communities represented the rich heritage culture of Canada, inclusive education was providing equitable sources to people with different clinical diagnosis. My perception of ecological justice was limited to global warming and environmental activism. Similarly, I never thought of the trauma, fear, and day to day challenges faced by LGBQ2+ people and how it affected their wellbeing and lives. It is here, that I learned more about these issues, and dismantled my own assumptions. This e-portfolio exhibits my learning, growth, and engagement with course contents.

                Dry leaves and pinecones, I collected in the pouring rain from the ground as I revisited the park to reflect on my relationship with the land and my ways to look at nature. I had many ideas to do the art-based project, which required glue, scissors, wire, or tape. I limited myself to use only one thing (twine) other than collected material. Suddenly, things became challenging. Leaves were wet, so I put them to dry. They curled up. I thought I can make a mobile. I tied them together with twine. Cones were fine but leaves were fragile. I was not able to string them how I wanted to. I end up putting pinecones at the bottom and inserting other leaves into it. I cut the twine with sharp edged rock, not with scissors and not used my teeth (I wanted to). I created a tree. I imagined myself in the hot tropical island and now tree resembled with a palm tree. Every time I rearranged the bunch of leaves, I saw something different. I was happy, relaxed, not worried about the outcome and most of all, I had fun.

                                    <h3> Colonization of education</h3>
                                    <p class="mb-4" style="text-align: left; line-height: 200%;">
                                      The purpose of education through colonial lens is to learn the curriculum by memorizing or practicing enough, get good grades, get admission into university for higher studies, and with the professional degree secure a high paying job, at least I believed so. As I went through the readings offered in EDUC# 400, was able to grasp the idea that white, western European culture molded the socio-cultural, economic, and political practices to their benefit. Stanley, T. (2003) in his case study scribed, “State-controlled schooling was integral to the construction of supremacist hegemony in BC.” He further voiced that white supremacist ideologies were not only offered as superior and solitary choice, but other exciting culture and race were rendered as ‘morally depraved and illegitimate’ thus okay to be indoctrinated (p.44).
                                      <br /> <br />
                                      I have not questioned the education system before or analyze it in this angle. It was like revealing the conspiracy in a horror story.

                                    <h3>Redefining Education</h3>
                                  <p class="mb-4" style="text-align: left; line-height: 200%;">
                                    Education has become synonym to economic progress and technological advancement. It has enhanced the polarization of wealth and means. Contemporary education emphasizes on theories, answers, conceptual and technical knowledge instead of questions, values, and ethics. Purpose of education is to enable humans as responsible caretakers, who use their knowledge to restore the balance of our natural world (Orr, 2004 p.12-14).                                  </p>
                                  <img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/p1-1.jpg" />
                                  <p class="mb-4" style="text-align: left; line-height: 200%;">
                                    That means education should be meaningful to individuals, help them enhance their skills and knowledge to contribute back locally and globally. Eisner, (2002) affirms, “Education is a process of learning to create ourselves” (p.3). Now the questions come in my mind such as: how can we guide children that learning is important, not the results? How can this shift in the education practices is attainable? Most of us are the products of the colonial education system, been benefitted and continued to get advantage from it. Until we analyse critically, understand, and accept the harm it caused to other cultures, and languages, we cannot make any progress. The next step we can take by including Indigenous people and other settlers’ cultural practices and languages into our current pedagogies.
                                  </p>
                                  <h3>Indigenizing education</h3>
                                  <img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/p1-2.jpg" />
                                  <p class="mb-4" style="text-align: left; line-height: 200%;">
                                    Indigenous learnings, which were undervalued and systematically diminished by colonial system, are based on wellbeing of self, family, community, and the land (Learning first people poster, n.d.). Indigenous learning promotes holistic growth of an individual and being responsible for their actions. Davidson, S. (2021) in her Sk’ada’ Principles you tube video explains the values of Indigenous ways of learning. Her video enabled me to figure out the importance of learning by heart and why it is different. When children were taught in their native environment by the people who they have strong relationship, learning happens naturally through observation, curiosity and mimicking the actions of others. To restore the balance between people and nature, indigenous practices are critical.

                                      Going off from redefining education my attention shifted to the effects of colonial education on our ways of living over time. Self-sustaining civilizations were marginalized, growth of industrialization and consumerism led us believe that happiness and wellbeing can be achieved through consumptions (Murphy, 2000). Desire to consume more, distorted the natural balance between human and the world around. We are facing the Corona virus pandemic globally. Locally we delt with wildfires, heat domes and are facing the worst flooding in the region. We have failed to see that we are part of the nature. We will be finished without it.  We are constantly exploiting it for our benefits and distorting the natural balance. “Walk in such a way that each step is a greeting to mother earth.” Kimmerer R. (2014, p. 206) quote is much more relevant today than ever before.” Vast destruction caused my flooding in Southern region of British Columbia is telling us to rebuild, repair our relationship with nature.

                                      David Chang in the Land-Based Eco-Justice seminar explained that restoration of eco-system is essential to human survival. He explained that marginalized groups who face the inequalities are worst affected with environmental damages such as air pollution, water contamination, poor housing and under lying health conditions. Environmental justice aims to provide fair chances to them. I have included two of David Cheng’s slides which allowed me to engage with nature in a deeper sense, to accept nature as my teacher and reminded me of my role towards land-based pedagogy. Aboriginal culture practices respect the land and protect it. By adapting the Indigenous perspective, we can save the land and conserve water.
                                      <br /> <br />“If you want to learn about something, you need to take your body onto the land and do it” (Simpson, L., in Chang, D., 2020). First and foremost, thing is to be outside, not confined in the four walls of the classroom. Plan your lesson according to place around your school community, take students to natural places, give them time to connect, revisit, and let them explore, observe, and be part of that place.
                                      <br /> <br />Another story of land-based pedagogy stayed with me was fish ladder project. In Exploration B teacher advocacy presentations, Alexandra (Ola) Cholewa who works at an Environmental school at Maple Ridge talked about fish ladder awareness project. She described this project as a learning opportunity where students were engaged in an activity which they were passionate about, felt connected with, and channeled their skills and energy for a cause. <img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/p2-3.jpg" />
                                      Looking back at my notes, I highlighted some words which represented the deep engagement of the students. Students put their minds to learn from their hearts. That is what I want to bring in my classroom. Enable students to care for the cause they believe in and turn their ideas into reality without worrying about winning or losing. By winning and losing, I meant not caring about the outcomes. Fighting for ecological justice may not end up in desired outcomes but can bring awareness to challenge unfair practices of colonial system.

                                    My educational commitment as teaching assistant is has been limited to the inclusion of students with clinical diagnosis into the regular classrooms. Often, I am frustrated with ableism views and people’s idea of correcting or comparing students with disabilities to a typical or regular student. Leaving no one behind is the message I gather from the series of you tube videos: Getting to know their stories and experiences. Disability combined with other differentiations based on individuals’ race, culture, religion, language, or socio-economic status amplified their challenges to survive and lead a normal life. Inequalities are socially constructed and deep rooted into our lives. We are so tuned with them that we do not even see until someone points at it. Then we simply agree with the mainstream narratives to do something about inequalities, without even questioning our biases towards it. People with disability can contribute to the society, so it is not okay to deprive them with amenities which our available to able body people. Young, S. (2014, April) affirms in her Ted talk that we have been lied about disability that it is a bad thing. Living with disability does not make people exceptional.
                                    <img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/p3-1.png" />
                                      As a society we assume that people with disability cannot overcome with their challenges. Apart from the bodily limitations and diagnosis, people with disability are real people, they deserve to be treated who they are. I want to move forward in my educational journey with Stella’s words, “I want to live in a world where disability is not the exception, but the norm… where we don’t have such low expectations of disabled people”. Every individual needs to be valued for their work and intelligence. When things are valued, they become a source of strength to that person. Over caring serves passively in the process of learning by their own efforts (Malaguzzi, L., P.2).
                                    Deficit based approach and ableism perspective restricts us to accept individuals as who they are. Allocation of resources and funding further divide the gap between labelled and non-labelled students. Apart from physical and cognitive disabilities our education system labels students based on their competencies in English and French languages.

                                    <h3>Inclusion for Multilingual Learners</h3>
                                    <p class="mb-4" style="text-align: left; line-height: 200%;">
                                      In all our class discussions, my peers have expressed their feelings of discomfort, while getting extra support as ESL learners or even labeled as ESL for funding purposes. I was on the other side of these stories providing extra support and have wondered why students do not want to take help. Listening to other side of the story, I realized that extra support could be emotionally draining and excluding students from their social groups. It defeats the purpose of providing support for students’ success. During our lectures on Language Identity and Language Diversity, Isabelle Cōté explained the historical context of languages in Canada. BC school system is evolving from One Nation One Language to bilingual French and English to multilingualism. To do so educators need to include second languages in their teaching practices rather excluding students from the classroom to improve proficiency in English language. She referred Cummins (2007) for the benefits of promoting bilingualism. Low academic achievements, poor economic background, learning difficulties and other differential needs of students do not impede students’ successes in learning second or third language as well (Arnett & Bourgoin, 2018, p. 24-26).
                                      As future educators it is our responsibility to create space for each student in our classroom. We need to shift away from what students cannot do to what they can do.
                                    </p>
                                    <h3>Strategies for Inclusive education</h3>
                                    <p class="mb-4" style="text-align: left; line-height: 200%;">
                                      I have an advantage of knowing Hindi as my first language and can communicate in Punjabi. I can certainly encourage students to reflect their thinking in other languages and make connections between their home languages. I can invite students and parents to share their knowledge and stories from other languages and cultures. I can represent inclusion in my classroom by putting out multilingual books and posters.
                                      In terms of inclusivity of students with special needs, I always gather information about the student from their parents, guardians, and siblings. If parents are comfortable, I invite them into the classroom to tell the success stories of little Johnny and share the information about his challenges. Then ask student how we collectively help him to feel welcomed in our classroom. Students like to switch roles and be the teacher. They suggest the best solutions to overcome obstacles. When we trust our students and give them opportunity to lead, they come up with good plans. Furthermore, inclusion becomes natural, not forced. I can put these words in gold:
                                    </p>
                                    <p style='text-decoration: underline;font-size:2.5rem;color:Gold;font-family:"Gwendolyn", cursive;'>
                                      “Inclusion must be more than just giving access to the setting: inclusion has to be about ensuring that access leads to some form of success.”
                                    </p>

                                    <h3>Sexual orientation or gender identity (SOGI)</h3>
                                    <p class="mb-4" style="text-align: left; line-height: 200%;">
                                      Brian Gidinski’s blog post addressing harmful public rhetoric, put me on the memory lane of my own university days. I graduated from Banasthali Vidyapith, a residential education institution which offers education to girls from second grade to getting a doctorate degree. Lesbian culture was evident in hostels, but overtly no one talked about it. There was no acceptance for lesbian relationships in the culture or society. There were many stories of students committing suicides, eloping, and found dead afterwards, ached my heart, but not gave me courage to challenge or voice my concern. We have come a long way from my college days’ experience to people expressing their sexual identity in their later years of life when they feel somewhat safe to take the bold step of coming out and revealing their identity. There is much work needed to be done in schools where children do not have a safe armour around. I could not agree more with the objective of SOGI in schools as Brian Gidinski explains, “What we do, as educators is make safe, inclusive spaces, so that students who have different experiences of gender are able to learn in an environment where they are not harassed, ridiculed or shamed for who they are, or who the members of their families are.” These students are vulnerable but safeguarding them does not mean putting others at risk.
                                      <br /> <br />
                                    Secondly, as an educator we should talk about the topics of sexual identity at early ages. Childhood innocence is a myth. To assume that children will not understand the heavy topics of gender identity and racism because they are too young is not true. Jean Piaget’s theory of cognitive development and Lev Vygotsky’s sociocultural theory are set of assumptions about children’s learning. These theories do not offer a comprehensive approach of learning. Children are producers and product of culture in that sense adults should not set standards for children’s learning capacities by age or grade. Children’s exposure to the issues matters. For example, a kindergarten student coming from a poor background who face hunger on daily basis would understand the plight of starving kids anywhere in the world, then a grade two student who have never faced such hardship. Children begin learning informally from their families, media, and the people who they interact with (Kelly, M. & Brooks, M, 2009, p.214).
                                    <br /> <br />
                                    My takeaway from the article, Young children and social justice, and Bryan Gidinski’s blog and presentation is to bring awareness towards different sexual orientation in my classroom.

                                      In this picture, I drew a traditional henna design on the feet of two girls and filled it with vibrant colours to express their relationship. Gender binaries limit our vision and exclude LGBQ+2 people from fitting in society. We should embrace people with different sexual preference in our lives, families, and communities without prejudice.
                                      Another important aspect we need to promote in schools is mental health and emotional wellbeing of our students.
                                    </p>
                                    <h3>Emotional wellbeing</h3>
                                    <p class="mb-4" style="text-align: left; line-height: 200%;">
                                      There is a growing concern about mental health in our school system. In British Columbia, four percent of children and youth are diagnosed with anxiety disorder (Waddle et al, 2014 in EASE workshop slide). Everyday Anxiety Strategies for Educators (EASE) are co- developed by Ministry of Children and family Development and Anxiety Canada. I understood that feeling anxious from time to time through daily life experiences is part of growing up. Anxiety is like an alarm system of our body which warns us for upcoming dangers. It is in our genes. Humans have survived and thrived because of it. Time has changed; we do not have the survival challenges, but our body still reacts the same way. Our nervous system responds to the perceived threat and put us on the state of emergency responses-fight, flight, or freeze. When this state of anxiety hinders the abilities to cope with the normal stresses of life and work productively then it becomes a problem. We can conclude that anxiety can enhance or hinder the performance. It is important to catch the early signs of maladaptive anxiety such as defiance, aggression, disruptive behaviour. Left unaddressed, anxiety can negatively impact students.
                                    </p>
                                    <h3>Mental health in schools</h3>
                                    <p class="mb-4" style="text-align: left; line-height: 200%;">
                                      Kris Magnusson (2021) in his lecture advised teachers to be aware of the mental challenges young people face. In Canada, sexual minority youth, immigrant, refugee and racialized populations, adolescents in the child welfare system and Indigenous youth are at elevated risk of mental health concerns and suicidal behaviour (slide 11). He urged to separate mental health from mental illness. These two terms are not synonyms. Mental health co exists with mental illness. By promoting mental health educators can create positive environment and flourish mental health. Our emotional state is the biggest filter of information. We hear things what we want to hear and fill the gaps with our assumptions. Thoughts, feelings, and behaviour are connected.
                                      <img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/p4-2.jpg" />
                                      In our final class at campus, we did this activity to see the interconnectedness of thoughts, feelings, and behaviour. I was surprised to see the effectiveness of this model. By creating new beliefs and naming the corresponding emotion we can change the related behaviour. I was not able to get started with my portfolio but believing that I can do it (thought), I changed my feeling from being overwhelmed to be creative and was able to change my behaviour from procrastinating to set up a plan to work on my portfolio.
                                    </p>
                                    <h3>Strategies to manage anxiety at school</h3>
                                    <p class="mb-4" style="text-align: left; line-height: 200%;">
                                      Since 2015, schools in BC have actively promoting mental health literacy among students and teachers. Ease- Healthy Minds BC, Zones of Regulations by Leah Kuypers, Marc Brackett’s mood meter, Mindful breathing exercises are some of the strategies, which I have used and will continue to use for myself and my students. I have used breathing exercise during my land centered experience online to cut down my own anxiety before presenting.
                                      <img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/p4-3.png" />
                                      I have not explored the Indigenous perspective of coping strategies. My goal would be to look into authentic First People’s resources, connect with Elders, Aboriginal support staff members, language teachers and story tellers to find out meaningful connections between emotional and spiritual healing through traditional teachings.

                                      It took me a while to overcome with my own fear of advancing in my career. It was easier to sit back and criticize the short comings of current pedagogies with my presumptions. It was a challenge to dismantle my own believes about schooling, Indigenous communities, and social inequalities. We are genetically wired to find patterns and structure. It is simpler to follow a trail without thinking where it is leading us. But once you are aware that it is not the right trail, you are set to look for other options. EDUC# 400 gave me the right reasons to believe that education practices need to be revolutionized.

                                      <br /> <br />
                                      Remodeling education system is not easy. Cultural appropriation, complex nature of Indigenous languages, unfamiliarity of other cultures can be daunting and put us in a freeze mode. We can move away from fear and act by including Indigenous epistemology of self-care and care for others. It is better to become ‘imperfect accomplice’ than part of an oppressed system (Carrol et al.,2020, pp.9-16).
                                      <br /> <br />
                                      Moving forward, I am aware that learning can happen outside of the school walls. We learn when we are not emotionally stressed. Our curiosity led us to find new knowledge. We learn from nature, from people who we relate to. Learning should not be guided by set standards of evaluation. All students are capable and valuable contributor to the school community. Every student has a unique story to tell. Astrid Pedneault in her presentation advice future educators to honour the process of learning then the outcomes. Guide their learning by suggesting what happens when… or what if we try this. Together with your students decide what to learn and how to learn. Focus on what do they want? what do they like? what are their passion? what makes them happy? Remember, children learn with senses, emotions, and imagination. They remember their experience in the class, not the subject taught.

                                      In my journey to become a teacher, I want to express my learning in multimodal ways and improve on writing reflections. I want to keep evaluating my own biases and make a conscious effort to correct them. I will continue to take time for selfcare and care for my garden.
